There are two types of copying. 
1.)Shallow copying
2.)Deep copying

Shallow copying;
1.)It means that certain values or sub values are still connected to original values. 
2.)We use it when we need multiple variables pointing to a particular object or variable. 

Deep copying; 
1.)All the values are copied into the new variable and it is disconnected to the original variable. 
2.)We use it when we need to make a copy of our object. Then we have two copies and they both are separated. We can do different actions onto the objects and still have two different object. 

  Implementing Deep copy
    >There are different methods to deep copy an object. Array & Objects have different methods for deep copy. 
        
        Array
        #Array Slice Method
        #Array Concat Method
        #Spread Operator ES6
        #JSON.stringify() + JSON.parse() //This is used for very complex arrays.    

        Object
        #Object.assign() methods
        #Spread Operator (...)
        #JSON.stringify() + JSON.parse() //for complex objects
